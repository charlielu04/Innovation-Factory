# Northrop Grumman Innovation Factory Hack Week
 For this Hackathon, our team (Charlie Lu, Eddy Qiu, Taseen Forhad, and Zach Wu) decided to take on challenge B -
"Write a program that ingests a provided image set or video feed and then produces an event stream / log of objects identified."

Our solution was a "Where's Waldo" image detector, which was implications for business values to companies like Northrop Grumman.
